Release v2.7-dev
================

...


Release v2.6.1 (May 26, 2020)
=============================

* Bugfix: Make on-the-fly installation of Sphinx extensions from /WHEELS work.


Release v2.6.0 (May 11, 2020)
=============================

Using `sphinx_typo3_theme v2.4.0`, `sphinxcontrib.gitloginfo v1.0.0` (new),
toolchain `RenderDocumentation v2.10.1`.

* Toolchain: FINAL_EXIT_CODE should now be trustworthy and either have
  value `0` (success) or value `255` (failure). `0` means, the toolchain
  came to an end and at least the step "build html" was successful.
  `255` indicates a failure where either the toolchain didn't come to normal
  end or html wasn't built.

* Theme: 'last modified' date appears in page html head section if
  available.

* Theme: 'Last updated' in the page footer with a link to the latest commit.

* Theme: Search result pages with highlighted search text show a link to
  deselect the hightlighting.

* Theme: The intra page menu is now appended to the left menu column to fix
  the - so called - "missing third menu level" issue.

* Theme: The logo is now defineable in the theme configuration file
  `theme.conf`.

* Toolchain: `dockrun_t3rd makehtml -c allow_unsafe 1` to skip the extensive
  and time consuming html postprocessing, to skip file include checks and to
  allow the reST 'raw' directive.

* Toolchain: `dockrun_t3rd makehtml -c sphinxVerboseLevel n'. With `n=3`
  the Sphinx build will be started with three times `-v`. This would mean
  `sphinx-build -v -v -v â€¦`

Bug fixes:

* Theme: Remove false warnings about illegal theme options
* Toolchain: Remove pip warnings about 'Cache dir not writable'.



Release v2.5.1 (Feb 26, 2020)
=============================

* Use toolchain v2.9.1: Fix static files


Release v2.5.0 (Feb 25, 2020)
=============================

* Use develop.zip of Sphinx extension t3targets to fix
  https://github.com/t3docs/docker-render-documentation/issues/80 Line numbers
  point to *.txt instead of *.rst.txt
  Fixed with `b0d6a7
  <https://github.com/t3docs/docker-render-documentation/commit/b0d6a7e743f437461fa571061fcb0963a9003589>`
  and
  https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/sphinxcontrib.t3targets/releases/tag/v0.3.0

* Use sphinx_typo3_theme from PyPi
* Use toolchain v2.9.0
* Add T3DOCS_WHEELS folder. If it contains Python wheel packages, those get
  installed within the container prior to rendering. So this is an easy way to
  extra install Python packages prior to rendering.
