Pull Requests
=============

You are welcome to submit pull requests to propose changes.

See `GitHub: Creating a pull request <https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/>`__
for information about creating a pull request.

Before submitting a pull request:

#. If it is not a minor change you may want to discuss this first: Use the Slack channel
   #typo3-documentation on https://typo3.slack.com (`register for Slack
   <https://my.typo3.org/index.php?id=35>`__ first) or create an `issue
   <https://github.com/t3docs/docker-render-documentation/issues>`__ for this.
#. If you make changes to the rendering, be sure to test this locally before submitting
   the pull request


Test Changes to Docker Image Locally
====================================

#. As usual, fork and clone the GitHub repository `t3dock/docker-render-documentation
   <https://github.com/t3docs/docker-render-documentation>`__
#. Enter the cloned repository::

      cd docker-render-documentation
#. As usual, create a branch::

      git checkout -b feature/xyz
#. You can build the docker image locally, using a different name::

      docker build -t render-documentation-local .

#. Now get a documentation project and use the locally built docker image,
   for example::

      git clone  https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/TYPO3CMS-Guide-ContributionWorkflow.git
      cd TYPO3CMS-Guide-ContributionWorkflow
      docker-compose run --rm html-local

The name/version used in the docker-compose.yml file must be the same one as used by
`docker build`. Here, we use the name **render-documentation-local**.

If your documentation project does not have a docker-compose.yml file for docker-compose
you can easily add one, see
`Quickstart with Docker Compose <https://github.com/t3docs/docker-render-documentation#quickstart-with-docker-compose>`__.

If you use the workflow with source / run and `dockrun_t3rd makehtml`, then once you
generated the documentation, you can
modify the file `Documentation-GENERATED-temp/last-docker-run-command-GENERATED.sh`
and replace the name / version of the Docker image with your locally built one and execute
this file to render the documentation with your locally built Docker image.

Use local version of Theme
==========================

While working on https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/t3SphinxThemeRtd you need to
test those changes.

In order to do so, run the Container and add another volume, in order to overwrite
the included theme. The additional volume looks like:

   -v /home/daniels/Projects/typo3/docs/t3SphinxThemeRtd/t3SphinxThemeRtd:/ALL/userhome/.local/share/virtualenvs/venv-y0waPz_e/lib/python2.7/site-packages/t3SphinxThemeRtd:ro \

The left side it the full absolute path to the theme. The right one is the absolute
path to the installed theme within the container.

NOTE that `venv-y0waPz_e` might be different for each build version of the container.
In order to get the working path, start the container and attach to it, and look up
the concrete path.
