info.txt about /ALL/venv and /ALL/venv/.venv

As of today we'll stop using 'pipenv' as it's not really actively being
maintained.


Before 2020-05-07
=================

We were thinking the following:

1. At image build time a Python virtual environment is created here from the
   Pipfile.

2. When running the container /ALL/venv is the WORKDIR = current dir.

3. It is expected that the TCT config file can be found here as
   /ALL/venv/tctconfig.cfg

4. We will be using subfolder '.venv' for the virtual Python environment.
   'pipenv' will use that folder automatically if it exists.

5. 'pipenv' documentation can be found at https://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/
   Example to run pipenv: `PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT=1 pipenv install`
